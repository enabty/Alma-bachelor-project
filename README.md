## Structure
### Branches
- [Main]-branch should always be deployable, therefore new branches are generated for new features and possibly later merged into main branch when they are completed.
- Branches should be named <type>-<name>, e.g. feat-new-top-layout, or impl-experimental-functionality.
- Branches should always represent features, bugs and hotfixes. Branches should not represent small changes in current functionality.
- [Main]-branch is protected by "require pulls request reviews before merging", Thus it needs at least 1 approved review before it is merged into the protected branch.

**Intended project structure will be implemented asap during the weekend**
